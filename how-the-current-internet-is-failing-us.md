# How the current Internet is failing us?

First of all, I am a huge fan of the Internet and forever grateful for its existence. Most of my growth is with the help of Internet. But over the years, its whole landscape has changed toward a negative direction that we all should be alerted. So this article hope to point out those bad apples in the basket.

## Too much censorship, too little transparency

Internet supposes to make the world flat, where everything is accessible by anyone and anything anywhere. It is not the case with the current version though. Censorship nowadays is not as how it was in the 90s but it still blocks people from getting information one way or another. Example of old-fashioned censorship is what the Chinese government is doing, they make their own search engine Baidu, their own social network Weibo to control citizens' flow of data. That shameless effort to refuse people's freedom is not so hard to detect, but there is a sneakier kind of censorship that was born later - the one crowded social platforms are using. Censorship is achieved when critical news is well diluted with unrelated news and your attention have already been paid so much that you get stuffed of information before reaching critical ones. Everyday there is war, plague or corruption that have been reported any here and there but they are well buried under a layer of tabloid news and advertisement. A lot of us has not been aware of how the bad debts is growing during the Covid-19 pandemic and how that will affect our life savings. But there's high chance that you know what is the hottest drama of showbiz in your country. The drama is not a product of the artist itself, why it matters so much? We passively receive too much information with zero value of knowledge.

P/s: Don't feel bad alone, I also deliberately found out about the bad debts of my current using bank when trying to collect examples for this article. Before that I have no clue what is going on with my finance.

On the other hand, while data is abundant, they are short-lived and very hard to trace edit history. Say you have a link to my post about how the Internet is being awful, today it might be online but tomorrow it can be shut down because of many reasons or even its content is changed to say the opposite. Those things can happen without anyone knowing, even me - the author. My post is a minor case, no one will get hurt but what if instead of my post, it is the report page of a charity campaign? Duplicate contigency, event-sourcing system are available options to prevent those problems mentioned but it is not by default and only acknowledged by a small proportion of Internet's participants.

## Dominant manipulation-based business model

Put it simply: advertisement is what make most profit on the Internet. Although it helps market products to interested users, the way companies rely too much on it cause tremendous consequence to community. At the first dawn, tool-based technology appears, attracts and then enable people to actualize ideas. Now, applications appears, attracts and extract people, luring us to use them whenever possible to expose our attention to advertisement. We used to use phones only when necessary, now we use them when nothing is necessary. 
I really don't mind seeing my favorite product floating on newsfeed when browsing social network, actually I found some of them useful but that feature cost me everything meaningful: from my privacy to my ability to focus. Every of my messages to my girlfriend are read by her and the AI program running to analyse 'What to sell to this guy?' or any advanced economic model. I am outthere, in those computers, naked to the world. But not only my messages, the application need much more data to be attractive and profittable. It also collect unspoken things, it knows if I go to anyone's profile page on purpose more than once, I care about them above average. So the app proactively send me notification when they have new update, just to make me tap on and open it. 'It's nothing personal, it's just the business. I mean you are the business' - said the app.

And I don't blame the app, I believe what it said is candid and true. First thing that make us join the Internet, staying active on those platforms is because it is fun and more important - it's free. So the owners of these apps have to come up with advertising as a way to make this relationship between them and users win-win. This solution keeps us mindlessly happy while they can harvest our data like crop. And they do it, just without your consent. To be more precise, with your mindless consent.

To make the pain hurt even more, platforms favor user-engagement over quality of content to maximize people's exposure to advertisement. As a result, content creators are encouraged to create clickbait, controversial content rather than informative, neutral ones. Then stupidity and hatred just spread like wild fire.
